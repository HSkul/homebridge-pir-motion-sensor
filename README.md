# Homebridge Motion Sensor

This is a [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin to make a Raspberry Pi connected with a PIR Sensor into a Motion Sensor.

Just add the following sample config to your homebridge config file located at this path `~/.homebridge/config.json`.

Updated the version requirement for rpi-gpio so that it is now >=.  This now compiles OK with node 12.  Follow homebridge installation instructions and the install this using: sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm /HSkul/homebridge-pir-motion-sensor.git
